# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an API Gateway Lambda Proxy service that acts as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI API endpoints. The service accepts standard OpenAI API requests (originally targeting GPT-4o mini) and transparently routes them to AWS Bedrock Nova Lite models, allowing existing client code to work without any modifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer with existing OpenAI GPT-4o mini client code, I want to switch to AWS Nova Lite by only changing the API endpoint URL, so that I can use Nova Lite without modifying any of my existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change my OpenAI API base URL to point to the proxy service THEN my existing code SHALL work without any modifications
2. WHEN I send requests with model "gpt-4o-mini" THEN the system SHALL automatically route them to Nova Lite
3. WHEN I use standard OpenAI parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.) THEN the system SHALL map them correctly to Bedrock
4. WHEN I receive responses THEN they SHALL be in identical OpenAI format that my existing code expects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service to use AWS IAM roles for authentication, so that I don't need to manage additional API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function runs THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles to authenticate with Bedrock
2. WHEN calling Bedrock APIs THEN the system SHALL use the Lambda execution role permissions
3. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL NOT require OpenAI API keys
4. IF Bedrock permissions are missing THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to list available Nova models through the /v1/models endpoint, so that I can discover which models are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call GET /v1/models THEN the system SHALL return available Nova models in OpenAI format
2. WHEN listing models THEN the system SHALL include model metadata like context length
3. WHEN models are returned THEN the system SHALL use consistent model naming
4. WHEN Bedrock is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling that maps Bedrock errors to OpenAI error format, so that my error handling code remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock returns an error THEN the system SHALL convert it to OpenAI error format
2. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with proper error structure
3. WHEN invalid parameters are sent THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation errors
4. WHEN Bedrock is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 503 with service unavailable error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service to be deployed with minimal AWS permissions, so that it follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN it SHALL only have permissions to invoke Bedrock models
2. WHEN accessing Bedrock THEN the system SHALL use least-privilege IAM policies
3. WHEN logging THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive request/response data
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose internal AWS details to clients

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the service to support streaming responses, so that I can get real-time responses for long conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set "stream": true in the request THEN the system SHALL return streaming responses
2. WHEN streaming THEN the system SHALL use Server-Sent Events format compatible with OpenAI
3. WHEN streaming THEN the system SHALL handle Bedrock streaming responses properly
4. IF streaming fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to non-streaming response

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the service to handle multimodal inputs (text and images), so that I can use Nova Lite's vision capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send images in OpenAI format THEN the system SHALL convert them to Bedrock format
2. WHEN processing multimodal content THEN the system SHALL preserve image quality and format
3. WHEN images are too large THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN unsupported image formats are sent THEN the system SHALL return validation errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request/response metadata
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN Bedrock calls are made THEN the system SHALL track latency and token usage
4. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide CloudWatch metrics for key performance indicators
