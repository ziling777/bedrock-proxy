# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the API Gateway Lambda Proxy service to AWS cloud infrastructure. The deployment should be automated, secure, and production-ready, allowing users to easily deploy and manage the OpenAI proxy service in their AWS environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the Lambda proxy service to AWS with a single command, so that I can quickly set up the infrastructure without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the deployment script THEN the system SHALL create all necessary AWS resources automatically
2. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide me with the API Gateway URL and endpoint information
3. WHEN I run the deployment script THEN the system SHALL validate prerequisites before starting deployment
4. IF prerequisites are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with remediation steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want OpenAI API keys to be stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager, so that sensitive credentials are not exposed in code or configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set up the deployment THEN the system SHALL store the OpenAI API key in AWS Secrets Manager
2. WHEN the Lambda function needs the API key THEN the system SHALL retrieve it securely from Secrets Manager
3. WHEN I update the API key THEN the system SHALL allow me to update the secret without redeploying the entire stack
4. IF the secret is not found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging for the deployed service, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is deployed THEN the system SHALL create CloudWatch alarms for key metrics
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information to CloudWatch Logs
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track response times and token usage
4. WHEN thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate alarms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the deployed service automatically, so that I can verify all endpoints are working correctly after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run automated tests against all endpoints
2. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL verify health check, models list, and chat completion endpoints
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL validate CORS headers and error handling
4. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want the deployment to be optimized for cost efficiency, so that I can run the service without unnecessary expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL use ARM64 architecture for better price/performance
2. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL set appropriate memory and timeout limits
3. WHEN CloudWatch logs are created THEN the system SHALL set reasonable retention periods
4. WHEN the API Gateway is deployed THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate throttling limits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to easily clean up all deployed resources, so that I can remove the service when it's no longer needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to remove the service THEN the system SHALL provide a simple cleanup command
2. WHEN cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL remove all CloudFormation stack resources
3. WHEN cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL optionally remove the Secrets Manager secret
4. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL confirm all resources have been removed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy to different environments (dev, test, prod), so that I can manage multiple instances of the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify the target environment
2. WHEN I deploy to different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific naming conventions
3. WHEN I deploy to different environments THEN the system SHALL allow different configuration parameters
4. WHEN multiple environments exist THEN the system SHALL prevent resource naming conflicts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the deployment to be idempotent, so that I can run it multiple times safely without causing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the deployment multiple times THEN the system SHALL update existing resources instead of creating duplicates
2. WHEN resources already exist THEN the system SHALL update them with new configurations
3. WHEN the deployment fails partway THEN the system SHALL allow me to resume from where it left off
4. WHEN I run deployment with the same parameters THEN the system SHALL detect no changes are needed
